# Intelligent Result Filtering and Scoring Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of intelligent result filtering and scoring mechanisms to enhance the quality and relevance of search results across all optimization modes.

## Current Limitations
- Basic document filtering without intelligent scoring
- No content quality assessment
- Limited source credibility evaluation
- Missing redundancy detection
- Simple similarity-based reranking

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Multi-Factor Scoring System

#### A. Content Quality Score
```typescript
interface ContentQualityScore {
  readability: number;        // 0-1 score based on structure and clarity
  completeness: number;      // 0-1 score based on information depth
  freshness: number;         // 0-1 score based on content recency
  relevance: number;         // 0-1 score based on query match
  bias: number;              // 0-1 score (lower = less biased)
  originality: number;       // 0-1 score based on uniqueness
}
```

#### B. Source Credibility Score
```typescript
interface SourceCredibilityScore {
  domainAuthority: number;   // 0-1 based on domain reputation
  authorExpertise: number;   // 0-1 based on author credentials
  publicationQuality: number; // 0-1 based on publication standards
  citationCount: number;     // 0-1 based on references/backlinks
  userRatings: number;       // 0-1 based on user feedback
  verification: number;      // 0-1 based on fact-checking
}
```

#### C. Query-Specific Scoring
```typescript
interface QuerySpecificScore {
  intentMatch: number;       // 0-1 based on intent alignment
  termCoverage: number;      // 0-1 based on keyword coverage
  semanticMatch: number;     // 0-1 based on semantic similarity
  contextRelevance: number;  // 0-1 based on chat context
  timeRelevance: number;     // 0-1 based on query time sensitivity
}
```
