# Query Enhancement Solution Summary

## Problem Analysis
**Current Issue**: Even in Balanced mode, simple factual queries like "What is the capital of France?" take 10-50 seconds because they undergo unnecessary full query enhancement.

**Root Cause**: The current system applies the same complex enhancement pipeline to all queries in Balanced mode, regardless of actual complexity.

## Solution Overview

### 1. Intelligent Query Classification System
- **Purpose**: Automatically detect which queries need enhancement vs. which can use fast path
- **Approach**: Rule-based classification with machine learning learning potential
- **Target**: 70-90% faster response times for simple queries

### 2. Fast Path Implementation
- **Simple Queries**: Bypass enhancement, reranking, and complex processing
- **Complex Queries**: Use full enhancement pipeline
- **Fallback**: Default to enhancement if classification is uncertain

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- **Reduced LLM Calls**: Only enhance when necessary
- **Faster Search**: Direct search for simple queries
- **Minimal Processing**: Skip unnecessary steps for straightforward questions

## Classification Rules

### Simple Queries (Fast Path)
- **Pattern**: "What is X?", "Who is Y?", "Where is Z?"
- **Length**: Short (≤ 8 words)
- **Content**: Factual indicators (capital, author, weather, date)
- **No**: Comparative language, opinion words, research keywords

### Complex Queries (Enhancement Needed)
- **Pattern**: "Best X for Y based on Z?"
- **Length**: Long (> 15 words) or multi-constraint
- **Content**: Comparative words, opinion seeking, research references
- **Keywords**: "best", "vs", "compare", "based on", "research"
